# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

It Systematically follows engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems

Software engineering enable creation of software applications and systems that powers up modern day life in communication, healthcare among other sectors.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The rise of agile methodologies in 2000
Introduction of structurerd programming in the 1970s
Establishment of software engineering as discipline in 1960


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Requirements- this involves gathering and documenting the user needs and th systems requirements.
2. Design- this involves creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface
3. Implementation- This is writing the code to develop the software according to the user requirements and the software design.
4. Testing- This involves conducting tests to ensure that the software meets the quality standard and functional requirements
5. Deployment-this is where the developer releases the software to its users or the customer.
6. Maintenance- involves providing support, updates and enhancements to the sofware to ensure security and changing user requirements.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall is a sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards like a waterfall while agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach foucused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

1. Software Developer- This is a person who is responsible for writing code and implenmenting software solutions.
2. Quality Assurance- He/she ensures sotware quality by designing and executing software plans
3. Project Manager- He/She oversees the planning, execution and deliveryy of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDE helps by providing comprehensive tools for writting, debugging and testing of code, eg visual Studio Code. VCS are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members, eg Github


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Tight Deadlines
Technical Debt
Changing software requirements

These challenges can be overcomed through effective communication, regular reassessment of project goals and objectives, and also usng the agile methodology in software development.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

1. Unit-These involves testing individual components of a software to ensure that each component is functioning correctly
2. Integration- these involves testin interactions between components
3. System Testing- involves testing the entire software/sytem as a whole.
4. Acceptance-Involves testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Promt Engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
